1. Think about putting import statements all in top cell i.e.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.preprocessing import scale
from sklearn.cross_validation import KFold
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso, RidgeCV, LassoCV, LinearRegression

Then you can stack multiple methods in one line and easily see what packages are loaded in your notebook
